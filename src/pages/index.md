### End-of-life (EOL) notice

On August 12, 2026, the **Adobe Analytics 1.4 API** and **WSSE authentication** legacy services reach their end-of-life and will shut down. Current integrations built using these services stop working after this date.
  
If you use the Adobe Analytics 1.4 API, migrate to the [Adobe Analytics 2.0 API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/). If you use WSSE authentication, migrate to an OAuth-based authentication protocol in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console).

## Overview

The Adobe Analytics 1.4 APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. You can create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data. You can also manage components of Adobe Analytics, such as Data Warehouse requests or Report Suite settings. This documentation provides instructions on how to call Adobe's endpoints to return the desired data.

This user guide assumes that you have an intermediate understanding of Adobe Analytics. See the documentation for [Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/landing/home.html).
