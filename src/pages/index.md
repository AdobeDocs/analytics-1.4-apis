## Overview

If you are creating a new integration, Adobe strongly recommends using the [2.0 APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/).

The Adobe Analytics 1.4 APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. You can create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data. You can also manage components of Adobe Analytics, such as Data Warehouse requests or Report Suite settings. This documentation provides instructions on how to call Adobe's endpoints to return the desired data.

This user guide assumes that you have an intermediate understanding of Adobe Analytics. See the documentation for [Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/landing/home.html).

## 1.3 API End-of-Life

The 1.3 APIs are deprecated since 2016 and sunset as of August 2021. Users can no longer authenticate or make calls using this version of the API. Please use the 1.4 or 2.0 APIs instead.
