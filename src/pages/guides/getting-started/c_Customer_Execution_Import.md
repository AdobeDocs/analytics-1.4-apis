# Step 3: Customer Execution of the Integration Wizard

 

As a Partner, you cannot perform an action on the Customer's data unless the Customer has integrated your product into their account. When the Customer runs your Integration Wizard, it will perform all of the steps you have defined in it, including running the Product Builder scripts to create the classifications in their report suite.

The third tutorial of the series, [3. Integrate Partner Data Tutorial](c_Integrate_Data_Connectors_Partner_Data_into_Customer_Application.md#), walks you through the steps of how the Customer executes this Integration Wizard to enable it in the Adobe Experience Cloud. Once it has been executed by the Customer, the Adobe Engineering team takes the information from the active integration and writes some new JavaScript code, which the Customer then integrates in their application.
