# What is the Developer Sandbox?

 

The Developer Sandbox is a fully-operational Experience Cloud environment available to developers who intend to build integrated products. Developer can capture live data from tagged web properties or applications and leverage the sample data which flows into the system regularly, mimicking standard web traffic on an eCommerce site.
