# Mobile Marketing with Mobile Apps

 
The Adobe Experience Cloud provides native software development libraries \(SDKs\) to power Adobe Analytics, Audience Manager, Campaign, and Target in your mobile apps. Mobile marketing functionality, such as in-app messaging, acquisition tracking, push notifications, and location marketing are also powered through these SDKs.
