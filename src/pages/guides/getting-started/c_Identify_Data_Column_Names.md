# Step 3: Identify Data Column Names

 

The name of the classification in the UI does not always exactly match its associated header name, stored in the database. Again, you can use the Admin API to access this information, but an easier way to find classification header names is in the data template that you learned about earlier.

In this JJ. Esquire demo application, you can locate the sample data template with the brand and category classification headers in the solution files available in the Downloads area of this article.

You reference the header names when you are defining the header fields for the import job, which you learn about in the next step.
