# Web Services Error Codes

The following errors are returned when you come close to or exceed the usage throttling threshold of the web services endpoint.

A warning response will be returned if a rate of 4 requests / second is detected. An error response will be returned if a rate of 5 requests / second is detected. The error responses are documented below.

In addition to this rate limit, a reporting concurrency limit is also enforced at the report suite level. Only 8 concurrent reporting requests will be processed in parallel. If this limit is reached, new report requests will be added to a queue for the report suite and will be processed in the order they came in.

The queue for a report suite can be managed using the Report.GetQueue and Report.Cancel methods. More information is available here:
* [Report.GetQueue()](../reporting-api/methods/r_GetQueue.md)
* [Report.Cancel()](../reporting-api/methods/r_Cancel.md)

## Rate Limit Warning

Your response will receive the header "X-RateLimit: Warning"

## Rate Limit Error
