# Partner API Overview

 

The Partner API is designed to integrate third-party partner data into the Adobe Experience Cloud. Customers can purchase these partner applications and integrate the data into their report suite using the data connectors Integration Wizard.

This figure shows the two sides of the Partner integration:

Partners use the Partner API and Developer Connection web site to \(1\) Configure the product, thus creating the Integration Wizard and to \(2\) process the integration by managing data and running reports.

Experience Cloud Customers use the Integration Wizard to map the partner data to their own Adobe Experience Cloud data collection.

## Overview

Data connectors has two audiences: Partners and Customers. Partners have applications to sell to Customers of the Adobe Experience Cloud, and both have tasks to perform in a data connectors product integration. The previous figure outlines the tutorials in this series and the roles and tasks for each audience.

**Note:** This series is written for Partners who will perform all these tasks during the development phase. However, you must also understand how these tasks will be performed in the real production environment when Partners and Customers each have a role. In these tutorials, some of the tasks you perform are for the Customer role.

The central tasks that define the integration are in the Partner Application Configuration and Partner Data Integration tutorials, when the Partner creates the Integration Wizard and the Customer executes it. The following figure emphasizes these tasks and also illustrates the roles and tasks outlined in all the tutorials and articles, by number.
