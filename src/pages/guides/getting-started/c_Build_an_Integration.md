# Build an Integration

 

Before building an integration, you must register in Adobe's Solution Partner Program by clicking the *Join Program* link on the [program home page](http://solutionpartners.adobe.com). Developer accounts are subject to the not-for-resale \(NFR\) program described on the [Solution Partner Program site](http://solutionpartners.adobe.com/home/enablement/software.html).

After you have been accepted in the Solution Partner Program send an integration request to *mcpi@adobe.com* indicating which AMC product you would like access to. In your request, tell us the following:

-   What application you are integrating with Adobe Experience Cloud \(provide links where additional information is available online\)

-   Describe the customer use cases you are addressing

-   List joint customers who have contacted you requesting this integrated functionality

-   Provide a primary technical contact for provisioning the account \(include name, title, email address and phone number\)


In some cases we may schedule a one-hour orientation to review the account and discuss your integration use cases. These meetings are determined by customer demand and availability of resources.

After you determine they type of integration you want to build, use the developer resources in the following sections to get started.
