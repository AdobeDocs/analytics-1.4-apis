# Step 5: Customer Execution of the Integration Wizard

 

The Integration Wizard created in this tutorial is now ready for Customers to use. The next tutorial, [3. Integrate Partner Data Tutorial](c_Integrate_Data_Connectors_Partner_Data_into_Customer_Application.md#), shows how the Customer takes this Integration Wizard and executes it to enable it in the Adobe Experience Cloud. Once it has been executed by the Customer, the Adobe Engineering team takes the information from the active integration and builds the JavaScript library code \(**s\_code.js**\) file. The Customer then integrates this JavaScript code in their web application.
