# Step 2: Get Web Service Access to the Enterprise API

## Deprecation Notice

This documentation should only be used as a reference for existing integrations. When creating a new integration you should use the 2.0 APIs. [2.0 API documentation](/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/)


In this section, you will add web service access to your user login for the Enterprise API. You should work with your Adobe Experience Cloud administrator to get access.

1.  In the Adobe Marketing Cloud, navigate to **Analytics** \> **Admin** \> **User Management**.
2.  Select **Edit Users**.
3.  Locate your Login name in the Users table, and click the **Edit** link in the **Manage** column.
4.  In the **Access** section, add **Web Service Access**.
5.  Click **Save Changes**. When the administrator turns on web services access for a user, the system generates a User Name and Shared Secret unique to that user. You will need these credentials to run the code files for each article.

For more information, see [User and Group Permissions Changes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/permissions-changes.html) in the Analytics Help and Reference.
