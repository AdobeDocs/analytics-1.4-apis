# What are the Enterprise and Partner APIs?

 

Adobe provides two APIs for the Adobe Experience Cloud:

-   The Enterprise API provides Customers with programmatic access to collect, import, export and run reports on their data.
-   The Partner API provides Partners with a way to integrate their application's data into the Adobe Experience Cloud so that Suite Customers can optimize their businesses using more valuable integrated data through a simple wizard-driven process.
