# SAINT API Tutorial

 

Analytics collects online analytics data from your web site visitors, but this data may not include all of the information you want to have in the system for reporting purposes. For instance, Analytics may track the product SKU number for the products that your visitors viewed, but this tracking may not include details like the product name, color, size or brand.

Adobe provides the Analytics Attribute Importing and Naming Tool \(SAINT\) API for you to import additional data directly into your Analytics reports.

In this article, you will learn how to import and classify data using the SAINT API. You will also learn how to export the classified data for updating.

The following figure illustrates this API's role relative to the others in the Enterprise API.
