# API Tokens

Token limits are no longer enforced when using the Web Services APIs. Tokens are still counted for backward compatibility purposes, however we will not cut off access once that token limit has been reached. We will also not charge any sort of overages if you pass the historical token limit.

As this change this increases the volume of API requests that are available, see [API Best Practices](c_best_practices.md#) to help you get the best experience and performance.
