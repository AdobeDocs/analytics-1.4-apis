# Adobe Analytics

 

This step-by-step guide directs you to resources that you will require as you build a technical integration with the Adobe Experience Cloud.

**Pre-Requisites**: To implement an Adobe Experience Cloud integration using Adobe Data Connectors, your organization must first be an approved Community Technical Partner.

When the integration is completed and approved by Adobe it will become available to the customer using the Adobe Experience Cloud.

This guide will be updated regularly with new references and content.

## Initial review with Adobe

Adobe will provide support and product access to build integrations that are valuable to our joint customers.

The first step is to introduce your company and the proposed integration with Adobe. This can be done by sending an introduction and request an initial review of the concept to the Experience Cloud Partner Integration email address *mcpi@adobe.com*.

Within a few days Adobe will respond and schedule a conference call. The initial review typically covers an overview of your company, the relevant Adobe partner program, the use case, name accounts for the integration, a technical implementation discussion and if appropriate access to the accounts and information. This is the key kick off for the integration and it is expected that implementation resources on the partner side take the lead with support from Adobe.

## Learn about the software

Adobe Analytics is an advanced web analytics solution. Before starting integration, it is vital to understand the fundamentals about the base product and its primary uses. This will set the ground work for effective integration planning and design.

Work through the following video tutorials and study the *Analytics Implementation Guide* carefully:

- Visit [EnterpriseTV](https://outv.omniture.com/) and watch the videos in the Analytics implementation section.
- Review the [Analytics Implementation Guide](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/sc/implement/). This guide is especially important as it includes detailed information about the functionality of different variable types and events that are critical to master before building the integration.

## Build

- Forums are available for Experience Cloud solutions, the primary forum for Adobe analytics development can be found [here](https://forums.adobe.com/community/experience-cloud/) 

## Run and test

Depending on the exact characteristics of the integration Adobe will provide various accounts to use to build and test the integration. Depending on the type of account there are different usage limits. Adobe will detail the permitted usage for each type of account provided to your integration team.

## Deploy to production

When the integration is complete, Adobe will review and approve it before pushing it to production where it will be available to Adobe Marketing Cloud customers. To request a review of an integration send an e-mail request to the Experience Cloud Partner Integration email address mcpi@adobe.com.
