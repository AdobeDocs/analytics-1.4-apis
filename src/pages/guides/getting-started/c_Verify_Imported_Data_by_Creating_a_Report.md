# Step 5: Verify Imported Data by Creating a Report

 

If you want to verify that the bulk data was imported successfully, you can run a report to retrieve the imported data within the Analytics UI or programmatically. The first four tutorials of this series will walk you through programmatic report creation:

1.  Create On Demand scripts for reporting.

    See the first tutorial of the series, [1. On Demand Scripts Tutorial](c_scripting.md#).

2.  Package the On Demand scripts in the Integration Wizard.

    See the second tutorial of the series, [2. Partner Application Configuration Tutorial](c_Partner_Application_Configuration_for_Data_Connectors_Tutorial.md#).

3.  Run the On Demand scripts by executing the Integration Wizard.

    See the third tutorial of the series, [3. Integrate Partner Data Tutorial](c_Integrate_Data_Connectors_Partner_Data_into_Customer_Application.md#).

4.  Execute the On Demand script using the Partner.RunScript API call.

    See Steps 2 \([Step 2: Execute the On Demand Scripts using the Partner.RunScript API Call](c_Execute_the_On_Demand_scripts.md#)\) and 3 \([Step 3: Print the Report Data on the Console](c_Print_the_Report_Data_on_the_Console.md#)\) in the fourth tutorial of the series, [4. Partner Reports Tutorial](c_Create_Data_Connectors_Partner_Reports_using_the_Partner_API.md#).
