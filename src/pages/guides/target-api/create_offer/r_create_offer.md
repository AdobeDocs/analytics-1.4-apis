# Offer Create

The Offer Create API lets you create an HTML offer.

## Create the URL

For each operation add the parameters and values necessary to create an HTML offer in a T&T campaign. For example, use the following URL substituting the appropriate value for each of the URL parameters:

```
 https://testandtarget.omniture.com/api?client=user&email=user1@acme.com&password=pwordâ€‹&operation=saveHtmlOfferContent&offerName=name&folderId=#&version=2&content=<HTML HERE>
```

| Parameter | Description |

|**client** | \(Required\) The T&T client code. |
| **email** | \(Required\) The Email address associated with the T&T user performing the operation. |
| **password** | \(Required\) The T&T password associated with the specified email address. |
|**operation** | \(Required\) Identifies the type of T&T action to execute. To save an HTML offer, this value is always `saveHtmlOfferContent`. |
|**offerName** | \(Required\) The name of the offer. |
| **folderId** | \(Required\) The folder where you want to save the offer. Get the ID from [Folder List](../list_folder/r_list_folder.md#). |
