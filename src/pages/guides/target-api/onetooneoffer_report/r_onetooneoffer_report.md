# 1:1 Content Report

The 1:1 Content Report API lets you programmatically extract detailed visit and impression information for a single campaign.

This reports shows you the number of times each piece of content was displayed. This value is based on the impression count rather than the number of visitors. For example, a visitor could be displayed a piece of content multiple times in a single visit.

## Create the URL

For each operation add the parameters and values you need as a filter. For example:

```
https://testandtarget.omniture.com/admin/api?client=acme&​email=john@acme.com&password=mypassword&operation=oneToOneContentReport&​campaignId=21&environment=Production&start=2011-08-24T00:00:00​&end=2011-09-12T00:00:00&resolution=day&version=1
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-------------|---------------|
|**client** | \(Required\) The T&T client code. |
| **email** | \(Required\) The Email address associated with the T&T user performing the operation. |
| **password** | \(Required\) The T&T password associated with the specified email address. |
|**operation** | \(Required\) Identifies the type of T&T action to execute. To generate 1:1 Content reports, this value is always `oneToOneContentReport`. |
| **campaignId** | \(Required\) The ID of the campaign you want to query. To identify the Campaign List ID, Use the Campaign List API or look at the `campaignDescriptionId` parameter in the URL when viewing a campaign in the T&T Tool. |
| **start** | \(Required\) The report start date and time. Specify the date using the following format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`. |
| **end** | \(Required\) The report end date and time. Specify the date using the following format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`. |
| **environment** | \(Optional\) A URL-encoded host group name, as defined in the T&T Tool. By default, the environment value is `Production`. |
| **resolution** | \(Optional\) The period of the report, which can be one of the following values: `day` \(default\), `month`. |
| **timeZone** | \(Optional\) If not specified, the default time zone associated with the T&T client name is used. |
|**version** | Specify which version of the API you want to use. Set this to `version=1` unless there is a different version described in the documentation. |

**Note:** Parameters and values are case sensitive.
