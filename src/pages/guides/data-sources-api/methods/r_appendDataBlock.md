# AppendDataBlock

Appends an additional HTTP data block to a Data Sources data submission.

## DataSource.AppendDataBlock Parameters

Individual data blocks can contain no more than 10,000 data rows (to keep the HTTP POST below 10MB), so you might need to submit data in multiple data blocks.

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-----------|
| **reportSuiteID** | `string` | Yes | The ID of the report suite where you want to submit the data block. |
| **dataSourceID** | `string` | Yes | The ID of the Data Source where you want to submit the data block. You can get this ID by calling [DataSource.GetIDs](r_getIDs.md#). |
| **blockID** | `int` | No | The ID of the first block sent for this data submission. [BeginDataBlock](r_beginDataBlock.md#) returns `blockID` in its response, as long as `endOfBlock` is not included in the `BeginDataBlock` call. |
| **rows** | `rowArray` | Yes | The data to submit to Analytics collection servers. |
| **endOfBlock** | `string` | No | Indicates if this is the last block in the data submission. You can use the `endOfBlock` parameter in the following ways. **Self-terminating:** Include `<endOfBlock/>` to indicate that this is the last block in the data source. Data Sources then queues the Data Source for processing. **With Parameter:** Include either false or 0 as an `endOfBlock` parameter to indicate this block is NOT the last in the data source. **Note:** If supported by your SOAP client, you can also exclude the `endOfBlock` parameter to indicate that this block is not the last in the data source. |

## DataSource.AppendDataBlock Response

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|**status** | `string` |Indicates if the call was successful. Valid return values include `Failed` or `Success`. If the call fails, Data Sources returns an error message.|
|**fileID** | `int` |The ID generated by the Processing Queue to identify a particular Data Sources submission. This value is a uniform identifier, independent of the particular data submission method (HTTP vs. FTP). This parameter is assigned a value only when the data block includes the `<endOfBlock/>` tag.|
