# Data Sources ID

The Data Source ID is a numeric value that identifies the type of data source.

Many of the Data Sources methods described in the Data Sources API require and/or return a Data Sources ID. The following table lists the available data sources with the associated Data Sources ID for each.

Below each Data Source name is the data source grouping to which the data source belongs. *Data Source Groupings* identify different types of data sources that have similar underlying capabilities and requirements. Groupings provide a way to categorize data sources from the perspective of the back-end systems that process data sources.

The Data Sources API organizes data sources based on grouping rather than category and type used in the Data Sources UI in Analytics. For more information about data source groupings, see "Data Source Groupings" in the [*Data Sources User Guide*](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/sc/datasources/oms_sc_data_sources.pdf), which is available in **Help** \> **Documentation**.
