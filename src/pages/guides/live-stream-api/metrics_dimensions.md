# Metrics and Dimensions

Lists the metrics and dimensions that can be retrieved using Analytics Livestream.

 

Periodically, new fields will be introduced to the Livestream output. Your Livestream client should be configured to handle this scenario and continue to process and translate the known fields.

|Metric/Dimension|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|bot| Contains either `<Bot>` or `<Not a bot>` to indicate bot and none bot traffic.|

|mobileAudioSupport| |
|mobileColorDepth| |
|mobileCookieSupport| |
|mobileDeviceName| |
|mobileDeviceType| |
|mobileManufacturer| |

|products| ```"products": [{    "category": "Clothing", "evars": {},    "events": {        "event61": [{        "count": 3        }]    },    "name": "Mens Black Running Shoes",    "revenue": 1799,	//Divide by 100 to get revenue    "units": 15  }]``` |
|purchaseId|Unique ID for the transaction.|
|receivedTimeGMT|Time hit was received by Adobe in GMT. Uses the Unix timestamp \(epoch time from 1/1/1970\). Set by Adobe servers.|

|tnt|The test-and-target field used in Target. The `actionId` and `actionName` never have values. <br /><br />This field is populated when two conditions are present:<br /> - The `TNT` and `ECOMMERCE` options are both enabled for the Report Suite. <br /> - A hit (browser action) includes a non-empty `tnt` or `tntAction` field. <br /><br />When the `tntAction` is not empty, this field contains all unique entries from `tntAction`, except for `actionId` and `actionName`. <br /><br />Example:<br />```"tnt":[{"campaignId":"46352","recipeId":"123","trafficType":"1","actionId":"","actionName":""},{"campaignId":"13234","recipeId":"23","trafficType":"0","actionId":"","actionName":""}]```|
|tntAction|The enhanced test-and-target field used in Target. Unlike the `tnt` field, the `actionId` and `actionName` have values set. <br /><br /> This field is populated when two conditions are present: <br />- The `TNT` is enabled for the Report Suite <br />- A hit (browser action) includes a non-empty `tntAction` <br /><br />Example: <br />```"tntAction":[{"campaignId":"52060","recipeId":"81","trafficType":"1","actionId":"0","actionName":"Experience Entrance"},{"campaignId":"13234","recipeId":"23","trafficType":"0","actionId":"1","actionName":"Experience Visit"}]```|

|userAgent|User agent as found in the HTTP header sent from the browser.|
|usesPersistentCookie|A flag indicating if 3rd party cookies and/or persistent cookies are enabled.|
|visIdHigh|Part 1 of the visitorID. The combination of two visitor IDs \(visid\_high and visid\_low\) creates a unique visitor ID.|
|visIdLow|Part 2 of the visitorID. The combination of two visitor IDs \(visid\_high and visid\_low\) creates a unique visitor ID.|
|visIdType|Specifies how the visitorID was calculated.|
|zip|Zip code \(i.e. 84604,85381\) passed in by JavaScript.|

## More info on Events

 "**count**": This is the value of the event. For counter events it is a 1 or 0. For currency or increment events it is an integer. All values are stored as integers for the sake of speed. You can move the decimal by the number of places listed in the exponent. \(e.g. If count is 150 and the exponent is –2 then the value of the event is 1.50

 "**exponent**": This is the number of decimal places to move "count".

 "**unique**": This is used for event serialization and will have the serialization value for de-duplication. This feature is used rarely.

 Events are represented by the following strings:

-   "revenue"
-   "productViews"
-   "carts"
-   "checkouts"
-   "cartAdditions"
-   "cartRemovals"
-   "cartViews"
-   "event\#" \(where \# represents custom event 1-1000\)

## Data Processing Order

The metrics and dimensions in Livestream are partially processed according to the following data processing order list:

1.  Data collection \(JavaScript, mobile libraries, data insertion, dynamic variables, and so on\)
2.  Processing Rules
3.  VISTA
4.  Geolookup \(by default, can be changed to occur before VISTA\)
5.  **Analytics Livestream** 
6.  Persist Attributes \(not available in Livestream\)
7.  Visit Attributes/Metrics \(not available in Livestream\)
