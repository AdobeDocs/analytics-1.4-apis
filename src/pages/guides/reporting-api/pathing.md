# Pathing Reports

 

There are two kinds of pathing reports, "Pathing" and "Fallout".

## Pathing Report \(the "pattern" parameter\)

A pathing report is generated by combining up to five patterns in a list to specify a match. For example:

**Next Page Report** 

```
"pattern": [
    ["videoPage5"],
    ["::anything::"]
]
```

The first pattern matchs the page named videoPage5, the next pattern matches any page.

**Previous Page Report** 

```
"pattern": [
    ["::anything::"],
    ["videoPage5"]       
]
```

**Next Page Flow Report** 

```
"pattern": [
    ["videoPage5"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"]
] 
```

**Not** 

```
"pattern": [
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::not::","videoPage5","videoPage6"]
]
```

**Special Page Names** 

Using the names of pages on you site along with the special page names in the following table, you can generate a number of useful pathing reports.

|Value|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|::anything::|Any page, including entered and existed|
|::not\_entered::|Anything except entered the site|
|::not\_exited::|Anything expect exited the site|
|::entered::|Entered the site|
|::exited::|Exited the site|
|::not::|Used before a pagename\(s\) to negate it. IE. "::not::","page1"|

## Fallout Report \(the "checkpoints" parameter\)

Fallout reports can be generated for the Visits metric using page, sitesection, or a prop \(if pathing is enabled\). To generate a fallout report, provide a list of up to 8 values to use as checkpoints. The number of pageviews returned for each checkpoint indicates the number of pageviews that successfully satisfied all checkpoints up to and including that point.

Example request:

```
{
  "reportSuiteID": "rsid",
  "dateFrom": "2014-01-01",
  "dateTo": "2014-01-02",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "id": "pageviews" //This metric is required for all fallout reports. It is the only metric currently supported.
    }
  ],
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "page", //Only 1 element can be specified. Valid elements are page, sitesection, and prop## (if pathing enabled).
      "checkpoints": [        //This is the list of checkpoints (Maximum 8 items)
        "videoPage3",
        "videoPage2",
        "videoPage1"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "locale": "en_US"
}
```

      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "videoPage2",
      "url": "http://example.com/videoPage2",
      "counts": [
        "53"                //This is the number of visits that continued (27%)
      ]                     //Meaning that 130 exited the site (73%)
    },
    {
      "name": "videoPage1",
      "url": "http://example.com/videoPage1",
      "counts": [
        "20"                //This is the number of visits that continued (37%)
      ]                     //Meaning that 33 exited the site (63%)
    }
  ],
  "totals": null,
