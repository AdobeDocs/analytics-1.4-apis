# Pathing Reports

There are two kinds of pathing reports, "Pathing" and "Fallout".

## Pathing Report (using `"pattern"`)

A pathing report is generated by combining up to five patterns in a list to specify a match. For example:

```json
"pattern": [
    ["videoPage5"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"],
    ["::anything::"]
] 
```

Using the names of pages on you site along with the special page names in the following table, you can generate a number of useful pathing reports.

Value | Meaning
--- | ---
**`::anything::`** | Any page, including entered and existed
**`::not_entered::`** | Anything except entered the site
**`::not_exited::`** | Anything expect exited the site
**`::entered::`** | Entered the site
**`::exited::`** | Exited the site
**`::not::`** | Used before a value to negate it. For example, `"::not::","page1"`

## Fallout Report (using `"checkpoints"`)

Fallout reports can be generated for the Visits metric using `page`, `sitesection`, or a `prop` (if pathing is enabled). To generate a fallout report, provide a list of up to 8 values to use as checkpoints. The number of pageviews returned for each checkpoint indicates the number of pageviews that successfully satisfied all checkpoints up to and including that point.
