# Analytics Metrics

Provides a list of metrics available in Analytics.

A *metric* is a structure that specifies the type of event data captured in the report.

## Calculated Metrics

Calculated metrics are returned along with the other reporting API metrics. The IDs of these metrics are in the form

```
f:<number>
```

Where `<number>` is some integer value.

The metric type, decimal precision, and formula \(where applicable\) are included for all metrics.

## Overtime-Only Metrics

Some metrics are only valid in overtime reports. Use Report.GetMetrics with the dateGranularity parameter to programmatically get a list of these metrics.

-   averagetimespentonsite
-   averagevisitdepth
-   customersdaily
-   customersloyal
-   customersmonthly
-   customersnew
-   customersquarterly
-   customersreturn
-   customersweekly
-   customersyearly
-   mobileviews
-   mobilevisitorsdaily
-   mobilevisits
-   returnvisits
-   returnvisitsdaily

If you try to run an overtime report on an unsupported metric, a `metric_unsupported_in_overtime` error occurs.

## Permissions

Specific users may not have access to certain metrics. The metrics returned by `GetMetrics` reflect those restrictions. Requesting a metric that one doesn't have permission to access will result in a `metric_inaccessible` error.
