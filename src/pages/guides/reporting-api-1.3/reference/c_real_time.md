# Real Time Reports

Real Time API reports let you view orders, revenue, units, custom events, instances, and other metrics with up to three correlated dimensions to create granular, real time dashboards with seconds of latency.

Real time reports operate most efficiently with frequent requests. We recommend between 15-30 seconds between updates.

1. \(Optional\) Get current real time configuration [ReportSuite.GetRealTimeConfiguration](../../admin-api-1.3/methods/report_suite/r_GetRealTimeConfiguration.md) 

 You'll receive a struct with the current configuration, similar to the following:

```
{
	"correlations":[
		{
			"min_granularity":1,
			"metric":"instances",
			"elements":[
				"prop2",
				"searchenginekeyword"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

2. Save a new configuration [ReportSuite.SaveRealTimeConfiguration](../../admin-api-1.3/methods/report_suite/r_SaveRealTimeConfiguration.md) 

 Send in a correlations struct with the metrics and elements from the table in the next section that you would like to enable for real time reports.

 You can provide a single metric with up to three correlated elements. Note that you do not need to include each correlated element for every report. For example, based on the struct in step one, you can report searchenginekeyword instances without reporting prop2 instances.

 **Note:** Realtime configuration changes take 15 minutes to be reflected in reports.


3. Run a real time report Report.[GetRealTimeReport](../methods/r_GetRealTimeReport.md#) 

```
{
    "reportDescription": {
        "reportSuiteID": "rsid",
        "metrics": [
            { "id": "revenue" }
        ]
    }
}
```


## Classifications

To report on a classification, supply the `classification` property on the element. This property can be supplied on one element, the first element in a breakdown, the second element in a breakdown, or both elements in a breakdown. Currently you cannot request the same element twice in a breakdown, so you cannot break down `**element1:class1**` by `**element1**`, or `**element1:class1**` by `**element1:class2**`, and so on.

```
// product classification
{
    "reportDescription": {
        "reportSuiteID":"rsid",
        "metrics":[
            { "id":"instances" }
        ],
        "elements":[
            { "id":"product", "classification":"title" }
        ],
        "periodMinutes":"15",
    }
}
```
