# Supported XML Tags and Query Variables

When processing HTTP POST data submissions, only values in supported XML tags are processed. When submitting HTTP GET data submissions, only specified query string and HTTP header variables are processed.

The following table lists all supported XML tags, along with their associated query string variable equivalents and HTTP header variable equivalents, where applicable. The JavaScript variable column is provided for reference. Details about each of these variables is provided in the [Analytics Variables](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/sc/implement/?f=sc_variables) topic in the *Analytics Implementation Guide*.

To specify that a given row should be considered a page view, that row must contain either `<pageName>` or `<pageURL>`. To specify that a given row should be considered a link event, that row must include `<linkType>` and either `<linkName>` or `<linkURL>`. If a given row contains both `<linkType>` and either `<pageName>` or `<pageURL>`, Adobe Analytics will automatically clear out `<pageName>` and `<pageURL>` by setting them to `null`. Also, if a given row does not contain the minimum fields required to fully identify the row as either a page view or a link event, that row will be dropped.

Every data insertion must also include one of `<visitorID>`, `<marketingCloudVisitorID>` or `<IPaddress>`.

**Note:** XML tags are case-insensitive, capitalization is used only to assist readability.

Use the [getLocationHint](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-getlocationhint.html) function of the VisitorAPI to retrieve the correct `imsregion` value for the user.
