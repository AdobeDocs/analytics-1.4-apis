# Overview

 

The two authentication mechanisms discussed in this section are OAuth2 and WSSE.

OAuth is an open standard to authorization. OAuth provides client applications a 'secure delegated access' to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials.

[OAuth 2.0](auth_overview.md#) is the next evolution of the OAuth protocol and is not backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

The [WSSE](wsse_authentication.md#) authentication mechanism provides secured access for third-party applications via REST/SOAP APIs.
