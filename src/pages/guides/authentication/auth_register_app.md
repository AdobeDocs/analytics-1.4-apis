# Create an Application

Registering your app generates the client ID and secret that are required to authenticate.

1.  Log in to Adobe Analytics
2.  Go to Admin -> User Management
3.  Click the Legacy OAuth Applications tab
4.  Select one of the OAuth flows from the drop-down menu.
5.  Enter an application name and description. Then select the appropriate organization and scope and click **Create**.
6.  View the **Application ID** and **Application Secret**. You can also update the application name, organization, and scope.

    The application secret must remain confidential. If the application secret is compromised, delete the application from Developer Connection and follow these steps again to generate a new secret.
