## How to deploy

For any team that wishes to deploy to the adobe.io and stage.adobe.io website, they must be in contact with the dev-site team. Teams will be given a path that will follow the pattern `adobe.io/{product}/`. This will allow doc developers to setup their subpaths to look something like:
```
adobe.io/{product}/docs
adobe.io/{product}/community
adobe.io/{product}/community/code_of_conduct
adobe.io/{product}/community/contribute
```

### Launching a deploy

You can deploy using the GitHub actions deploy workflow see [deploy instructions](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme#deploy-to-azure-storage-static-websites).
