Adobe makes every effort to provide reporting data quickly, however, there are many factors that impact report generation speed. The following sections explain many of these factors and contain tips to help you structure requests to get the business data you need as quickly as possible.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"report-queue\"\n    }}>{`Report Queue`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Each report suite maintains a separate queue of requests. If many reports are requested simultaneously, even from separate users, a small number of reports are generated simultaneously. As reports complete, remaining reports are generated in the order in which they were received.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When troubleshooting, it is essential to determine if the report you requested is taking a long time to generate, or if the report suite queue is backed up. The response from each report contains a breakdown of the time the report spent waiting and the time spent in processing that can help you isolate the cause.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If your requests are spending a lot of time in the queue, it is possible that other requests have filled up the queue. You can retrieve the current queue using Report.GetQueue. This method allows you to audit the reports that your company is running.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you find that another user has submitted a lot of requests `}{`(`}{`especially complex requests that take a long time to process`}{`)`}{`, it is usually a good idea to check with the requestor to make sure that the requests are valid. You can cancel waiting requests by using Report.Cancel.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Note that The API system is throttled on a company level, mainly to prevent DDoS type of attacks or buggy scripts from unnecessarily taxing the system. The limit is high enough that 99.9% of the our customers will never hit the limit. If you hit this limit, you will receive a Request.OverLimit error message.
