# Selecting a Company

If you are using Adobe.io JWT authentication with the 1.4 APIs you can select the company you are using with the `x-adobe-dma-company` header.

For legacy oAUth authentication if your Adobe ID is linked with multiple login companies, you can select which company is used for each API request by including the `X-ADOBE-DMA-COMPANY` header in the API request.

For Client Credentials and Service Account Grants, the company is selected at the time when the app is created.
