# Plan an Integration

 

You should be familiar with Adobe Experience Cloud Solutions and Core Services before planning an integration. A simple overview of the Marketing Cloud is available on the Adobe Experience Cloud [solution overview](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing.html?promoid=KAUCL).
